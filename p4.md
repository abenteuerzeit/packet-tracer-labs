# Dynamic Routing

Dynamic routing protocols enable routers to communicate with each other and share routing information automatically, without the need to manually configure each router’s routing table

Dynamic routing is a process by which routers share information about the network with each other, allowing them to build their routing tables without the need for an administrator to manually configure each route. They do this using a routing protocol—a protocol that defines how routers communicate with each other to share routing information and how they use that information to build their routing tables

Sharing of routing information is also called advertisement. R1, R2, and R3 advertise their known networks to each other

Dynamic routing allows routers to adapt to changes in the network by automatically calculating new routes

Route type D: **Diffusing Update Algorithm** (DUAL) used by **Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol** (EIGRP) to learn routes.

The adaptability of dynamic routing improves the resilience of the network; it is able to automatically recover from failures with minimal downtime.

dynamic routing protocols easily scale to support very large and complex networks

static routes have their own advantages, such as predictability and control. Because static routing involves manually configuring routes (specifying the next hop for each destination), they are useful in situations where you want to control the exact path that packets take

Routing protocols can be divided into two main categories: Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP) and Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGP). IGPs are used to exchange routing information within a single autonomous system (AS)—the network of a single organization. EGPs, on the other hand, are used to exchange routing information between different autonomous systems, such as between an enterprise and an ISP or between two ISPs

further categorized by algorithm type, which describes how the routers share information and calculate routes.
