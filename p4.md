# Dynamic Routing

Dynamic routing protocols define how to automate network routing table updates.
Dynamic routing allows routers to adapt to changes in the network by automatically calculating new routes.
**Advertisement** refers to the process of sharing known netowrk information between routers.


| **Route Type** | **Protocol**                                       | **Description / Meaning**                                                 |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **D**          | Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) | Refers to routes learned using the **Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL)**. |
| **R**          | Routing Information Protocol (RIP)                 | Refers to routes learned via **RIP**.                                     |
| **O**          | Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)                    | Refers to routes learned via **OSPF**.                                    |


Dynamic Routing Advantages: 
- Adaptability and netowork resilience: automatic recovery from failures with minimal downtime.
- Scalable: support very large and complex networks
Static Routing Advantages: 
- Predictability and control thanks to manually configuring routes (specifying the next hop for each destination). Useful in situations where you want to control the exact path that packets take

Routing protocols can be divided into two main categories, further categorized by algorithm type (how routers share information and calculate routes): 
1. **Interior Gateway Protocols** (IGP): Used to exchange routing information within a single autonomous system (AS), the network of a single organization. 
2. **Exterior Gateway Protocols** (EGP): Used to exchange routing information between different autonomous systems, such as between an enterprise and an ISP or between two ISPs

| **Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGP)** | **Path Vector**     | Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)                                                          |


**Routing Information Protocol (RIP)**: Simple. Small Networks or labs.
**Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)**: CISCO proprietary.Also known as *Advanced distance-vector protocol*. Large scale networks. RFC 7868. Advertise using metrics to reach a network. 

A metric measures the efficiency of a route to a destination network, preferring a lower value. It is like counting how many routers a packet needs to pass through to reach a LAN.

The key characteristic of distance-vector routing protocols is that each router doesn’t have a complete map of the network; for each destination network it learns about, it only knows the metric and next-hop router.

Distance-vector routing is sometimes called routing by rumor. Routers don’t have a complete map of the network; they only know what their neighbors tell them.

IS-IS is usually for Internet Service Provider networks. 

Link-state routing protocols have each router make a network connectivity map. Routers advertise their connected link states, used to calculate best routes to a LAN, which is CPU-intense and consumes memory, storage in link-state database (LSDB). Netowrks are divided into areas. 

Border Gateway Protocol, an EGP using path-vector to calculate routes.
